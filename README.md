# Hello !

I am an economics graduate student at Sciences Po, in Paris, and this is my GitHub account. 

I am very much interested in environmental economics and hope to work on the topic in the future. I am more proefficient in R, but I also have some knowledge in other languages. 

You can find university and personal projects, on my account. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
